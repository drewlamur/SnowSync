# SnowSync

SnowSync is a file sync utility tool and API which provides a bridge for off platform ServiceNow development using an IDE or text editor locally.

SnowSync syncronizes configured fields (scripts) for a ServiceNow instance locally, then watches for file changes and syncs back changes to the corresponding record.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'snow_sync'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install snow_sync
